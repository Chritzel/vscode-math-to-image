This is a VS Code extension to help you convert a standard LaTeX math equation like `$E=mc^2$` to an image like <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E%3Dmc%5E2"> that can be embedded inside Markdown files or websites that doesn't support rendering LaTeX yet (for example: GitHub README). Take a look the source of [this README](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeamMeow/vscode-math-to-image/master/README.md)!
