`vscode-math-to-image` is a VS Code extension that converts a standard math equation like `$E=mc^2$` to a image like <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=E%3Dmc%5E2"> (remote) or (local) that can be viewed inside websites that doesn't support rendering LaTeX yet. (Take GitHub READMEs for example.)
